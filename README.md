# Hi there 👋 I'm Julio

I'm a **backend-focused Software Engineer** with a strong background in **Linux server administration** and a deep passion for understanding how systems work under the hood. Python is my primary language, and I use it to build reliable backend services, automate processes, and design efficient solutions.

Driven by curiosity and a strong *“how and why”* mindset, I constantly explore new concepts and refine my skills. This approach has led me to work not only with high-level frameworks, but also to dive into **compiled languages such as C, C++ and Rust**, strengthening my understanding of performance, memory management, and system-level programming.

### My carrear

My profesional carrer begins as an Data Specialist at [Teleperformace Colombia](https://www.teleperformance.com/en-us/locations/colombia-site/colombia/), performing ETL task automations using python and SQL to process and load raw data into reliable pipelines.
As an engineer graduated from **Universidad de Colombia**, I consistently aimed to deliver **high-quality, reliable, and maintainable solutions**. My strong analytical skills, ownership mindset, and ability to quickly understand complex systems led to a **rapid professional growth**, allowing me to advance into a Data Expert role.
In this position, I took on greater responsibility in designing data workflows, improving system reliability, and collaborating closely with technical and business stakeholders to deliver scalable, production-ready solutions.
Additionally, I assumed responsibilities in **on‑premise server administration** and **technical leadership of exploratory projects**, where I managed data flows using cloud-based solutions, specifically **Microsoft Azure**. This experience strengthened my ability to bridge on‑premise infrastructure with cloud environments while leading initiatives from concept to implementation.
